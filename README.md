### Step-by-Step Instructions to Set Up Cloudflare Workers

#### 1. **Creating and Deploying a Cloudflare Worker via Cloudflare Dashboard**

**A. Sign Up or Log In to Cloudflare:**
1. Visit [https://www.cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com) and sign up or log in to your account.

**B. Create a Cloudflare Worker:**
1. Once logged in, go to the **Workers** section in the Cloudflare Dashboard.
2. Click **Create a Worker** to start a new Worker project.
3. You will be presented with an editor where you can write your worker script.

**C. Write a Hello World Script:**

In the editor, replace the default code with this:

```javascript
// hello-world.js (Cloudflare Worker)

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    new Response('Hello, World!', {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
    })
  );
});
```

**D. Deploy Your Worker:**
1. After writing the script, click **Save and Deploy** to deploy your worker.
2. Cloudflare will assign you a default URL (e.g., `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`) where you can see the output of the Worker.

#### 2. **Creating and Deploying a Cloudflare Worker via the Command Line (CLI)**

**A. Install Wrangler (Cloudflareâ€™s CLI Tool):**
1. **Install `wrangler`**, the CLI tool for interacting with Cloudflare Workers. This can be done via npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

**B. Authenticate with Cloudflare:**
1. Authenticate your `wrangler` tool with Cloudflare by running:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```
2. This will open your browser for you to log in to your Cloudflare account.

**C. Create a New Worker Project:**
1. Create a new Cloudflare Worker project using the following command:
   ```bash
   wrangler generate hello-world
   cd hello-world
   ```

2. This will generate a basic Worker template. You can now modify the Worker script to fit your needs.

**D. Modify the Worker Script:**

Inside the generated `src/index.js`, modify the code to output "Hello, World!" as follows:

```javascript
// hello-world.js (Cloudflare Worker)

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    new Response('Hello, World!', {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
    })
  );
});
```

**E. Configure `wrangler.toml`:**

Ensure your `wrangler.toml` file is properly configured with your Cloudflare account and project details. This file should look something like this:

```toml
name = "hello-world"
type = "javascript"

[env.production]
workers_dev = true
compatibility_flags = []

[account]
id = "your-cloudflare-account-id"
```

**F. Publish the Worker:**
1. Once your worker script is ready, deploy it to Cloudflare Workers with the following command:
   ```bash
   wrangler publish
   ```

2. Once the deployment is successful, `wrangler` will provide a link to access your Worker (e.g., `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`).

### Cloudflare Worker Script: `hello-world.js`

Here's the complete worker script for both Dashboard and CLI versions:

```javascript
// hello-world.js (Cloudflare Worker)

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    new Response('Hello, World!', {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
    })
  );
});
```

### 3. **Accessing the Worker**

Once deployed, you can access your Cloudflare Worker by visiting the provided URL. Whether it's deployed via the Cloudflare Dashboard or the CLI (`wrangler publish`), the output will be:

```
Hello, World!
```
